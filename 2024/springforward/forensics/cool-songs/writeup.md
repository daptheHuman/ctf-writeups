Program change appear to be an ascii encoded string. Decoding it looks like a related to flag string.
`}76092c1gv1h8-uji8-47q4-p327-528924q5{ffpzFFF4066"==Q`

Clean it
`zpff{5q429825-723p-4q74-8iju-8h1vg1c29067}`
It looks like a flag, but i think its decoded using vignere, so we need to find the key

Next check on the coolsong2.mid file too, and we get this 
`GJCCVDUJDPKPDDHM`
But i couldnt get anything with this key. But, since before we reverse it for the output string on first file, we need to reverse it again for this one.
`MHDDPKPDJUDVCCJG`

And then we decode the flag using this key
`nicc{5b429825-723f-4b74-8faa-8e1ae1a29067}`
